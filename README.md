Debugging Practice
==================

Here is some code that doesn't work!
Work out what the cause of the problem is, and write it down (I want you to tell me afterwards).
Then fix the code so the problem isn't there any more.

Getting started
===============

Get the gems:

`bundle`

Run the tests all together with `rspec`.

It is advised to run the tests for each excercie separately.

`rspec spec/rubygems_api_checker`

`rspec spec/basket`

`rspec spec/post_tagging`
